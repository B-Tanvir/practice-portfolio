                    I specialize in building complex web applications, leading front-end teams, digital product design
                    and
                    developing visual
                    design systems. I enjoy creating effortless user experience and designing delightful digital
                    products.
                    The entire
                    process of going from a concept to release and gathering user’s feedback on either client’s or my
                    own
                    products is what
                    makes me wake up everyday!
                    I worked with numerous clients from all around the world from early startups to well-established
                    companies. I always
                    seek new opportunities for cooperation on projects around interesting dashboards, design systems or
                    landing pages. Let’s
                    create something awesome together!
